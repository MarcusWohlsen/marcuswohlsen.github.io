		<p>Marcus joined <a href="http://godfreydadichpartners.com">Godfrey Dadich Partners</a> as an inaugural member of the firm’s editorial practice after an accomplished career as a journalist and author. At GDP, Marcus has led groundbreaking work in narrative design anchored by rigorous strategy. Clients have included Google, Lyft, IBM, Adyen, Nike, and National Geographic. His work is informed by expertise in emerging technologies and a deep conviction that effective design is clear, useful, and humane.</p>

		<p>As senior editor and writer at WIRED, Marcus led coverage of the tech industry’s ascent to its current economic and cultural dominance. He wrote and edited thousands of stories on Silicon Valley’s surge: the evolution and impact of artificial intelligence and cloud computing; the transformation of publishing and news in the social media era; the rise of the gig economy; and the spread of streaming, among the storylines that have defined the last decade. He also ran WIRED’s first-ever presidential election desk. Under his leadership, the audience for WIRED.com’s business coverage grew to more than 40 million visitors annually.</p>

		<p>Marcus is the author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307200/biopunk-by-marcus-wohlsen/"><em>Biopunk: DIY Scientists Hack the Software of Life</em> (Portfolio/Penguin)</a>, featured by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/05/22/136464041/biopunks-tinker-with-the-building-blocks-of-life">NPR</a>, CNN, the <em>Guardian</em>, and others. The book anticipated the rise of the democratization of biotech through cheap, accessible tools like CRISPR; it was later optioned by Legendary Television for development as a <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/zachary-quinto-biopunk/">scripted series</a>. As a longtime reporter in the San Francisco bureau of The Associated Press, Marcus covered the Great Recession and subsequent tech boom for a global audience through the lens of the California experience.</p>

		<p>Marcus is a graduate of Harvard and the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
